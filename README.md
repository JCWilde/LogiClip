# LogiClip
This project is a GUI application built with tkinter for working with Boolean algebra. It provides an easy-to-use interface for manipulating logical expressions and includes basic identities and definitions of logical operations. The application also offers a temporary text area for copying and deleting text, and an info button for quick reference.
