# LogiClip
This project is a GUI application built with tkinter for working with Boolean algebra. It provides an easy-to-use interface for manipulating logical expressions and includes basic identities and definitions of logical operations. The application also offers a temporary text area for copying and deleting text, and an info button for quick reference.

# LogiClip

LogiClip is a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with Boolean algebra, which is a fundamental part of computer science and digital electronics.

## How to use

In order to run it from your desktop just download the entire repo and hit send to desktop on the .exe. It should then be able to run cleanly.

You can then copy the expression to the clipboard by clicking the `COPY` button, or clear the temporary text area by clicking the `DEL` button.

## Logical operations

The following logical operations are available in LogiClip:

* AND | ∧
* OR | ∨
* NOT | ¬
* XOR | ⊕
* IMPLIES | ⇒
* IF AND ONLY IF | ⇔
* THERE EXISTS | ∃
* FOR ALL | ∀
* NULL | ⊥

## Boolean algebra identities

Here are some basic identities of Boolean algebra:

* Identity laws: a ∨ 0 = a, a ∧ 1 = a
* Complement laws: a ∨ ¬a = 1, a ∧ ¬a = 0
* Commutative laws: a ∨ b = b ∨ a, a ∧ b = b ∧ a
* Associative laws: a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c, a ∧ (b ∧ c) = (a ∧ b) ∧ c
* Distributive laws: a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c), a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c)
* De Morgan's laws: ¬(a ∧ b) = ¬a ∨ ¬b, ¬(a ∨ b) = ¬a ∧ ¬b
